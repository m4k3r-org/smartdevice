========================================

![LiBAT5V2A](https://github.com/infinityPV/infinityPV_INA233_Arduino-library/blob/master/extras/libat5v2a-ardu-solar-cell.jpg)

[*LiBAT5V2A Multiplatform *](https://infinitypv.com/products/electronics/libat5v2a) 


This is an Arduino IDE library for monitoring V/I and energy at different points in the infinityPV LiBAT5V2A evaluation board
through the INA233 ADCs on board. However, you can use the library for your own designs including INA233 ADCs :).  

Repository Contents
-------------------

* **/examples** - Example sketches for the library (.ino). Run these from the Arduino IDE. 
* **/extras** - Additional documentation for the user. These files are ignored by the IDE. 
* Source files for the library (.cpp, .h). 
* **library.properties** - General library properties for the Arduino package manager. 

Documentation
--------------
* **[LiBAT5V2A Brochure](https://infinitypv.com/brochures/LiBAT5V2A%20Brochure%20V2.pdf)** - Short description for the LiBAT5V2A evaluation board. 
* **[LiBAT5V2A Application Note](https://infinitypv.com/application_notes/LiBAT5V2A_applicationnoteV2.0.pdf)** - Application Note for the LiBAT52A evaluation board.
